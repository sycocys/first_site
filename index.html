With over ten years leadership experience, I excel at working within a group to prioritize and accomplish set goals. I specialize in customer service, retail product line, and crisis management. 
I have a firm belief that no matter what field of business you are in, the client experience is your number one product; everything else is secondary. It doesn’t matter how great your product is, if the client has a bad experience, they will lose faith in you and the product. I have found this to be true for retail products, service products, and even emergency services.
